# Diceroller Bot Manual

## Terminal Version

## GUI Version

## Possible Issues and Questions

1. It would be better if it works on the mobile app!

My bot uses Selenium to roll the dices, so it can't operate on an app, only on browsers. :unamused:

2. The browser do not open!

Make sure you selected a browser you really have installed on your machine. If you are using the terminal version, make sure you have the webdrivers on the correct folder. In any other cases maybe the problem is the version of your browser thats is not compatible with the bot webdrivers. 

3. The pages do not load.

The problem is probably your internet connection. Feel free to press F5 to reload the pages before start the bot. 

4. I start the bot and a error has appear. Something about it doesn't find something...

You need to be in the correct group you gonna roll the dices before start the bot, than make sure the page is completelly loaded. 

5. I think I find a bug.

Show me on the Issues page.
