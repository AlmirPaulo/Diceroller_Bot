# Diceroller Bot Manual

This is the Diceroller Bot manual. If you find any bug tell me on the [Issues page](https://github.com/AlmirPaulo/Diceroller_Bot/issues). 
For instructions about the installation, take a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/AlmirPaulo/Diceroller_Bot/blob/main/README.md) file. 
### Summary


## Terminal Version

I do not recommend this version unless you are one of (us) this computer geeks. Because in case you are not, you can be confused to handle with that Bash black screen and you probably never write a single command line. If that is your case download the GUI (Graphic User Interface) version. 
But if you ok with the terminal...you still should use the GUI version, but if you really want, let's go.   

### Requirements
* A terminal emulator
* Python 3
* Internet Connection
* Webdrivers
* Selenium Python module

### Webdrivers?

It's a technology that allows to automatize the browser. If you use Firefox you need to download [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) and if you use Chrome you need download [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/). In Linux (probably it should work on Mac too) save it in "/usr/local/bin".

### Running the Bot:


## GUI Version

## Possible Issues and Questions

**1. It would be better if it works on the mobile app!**

My bot uses Selenium to roll the dices, so it can't operate on an app, only on browsers. :unamused:

**2. The browser do not open!**

Make sure you selected a browser you really have installed on your machine. If you are using the terminal version, make sure you have the webdrivers on the correct folder. In any other cases maybe the problem is the version of your browser thats is not compatible with the bot webdrivers. 

**3. The pages do not load.**

The problem is probably your internet connection. Feel free to press F5 to reload the pages before start the bot. 

**4. I start the bot and a error has appear. Something about it doesn't find something...**

You need to be in the correct group you gonna roll the dices before start the bot, than make sure the page is completelly loaded. 

**5. I think I find a bug.**
